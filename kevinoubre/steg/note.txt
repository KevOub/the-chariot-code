of _Kawkab Amerika_, a goodly-sized sheet, in strange characters, but
with a pictured heading eloquent to all. There I saw the desert, with

hosts of desert-dwellers, on foot, on horseback, on camel, but all
gazing and pointing to the central sky, where appeared a radiant vision
of our harbor statue of Liberty Enlightening the World.
